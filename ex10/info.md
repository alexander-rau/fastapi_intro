# Example 10

Nothing new about FastaPI in the last two examples.
Just to introduce the testing mechanism in Python.

In this example, just run the command 'pytest' from the command line
under the app folder. The pytest will find main.py and tets_main.py
to conduct the test. No need to run uvicorn.
