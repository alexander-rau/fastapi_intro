# Example 8

Using Jinja2 module to render an html response.
A few interesting things to note:
1. The original instructor's GitHub code has a bug in this example.
2. The Jinja2Templates class allows relative path.
3. Jinja2 itself is a templating language with loops mechanism, which is not demonstrated in this example.
